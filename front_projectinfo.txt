<h1>Adopting BCH!</h1><p></p><h1>Why donate?</h1><p>Raising funds to start my tuk-tuk company and allowing me to become my own boss and accept BCH for payments.</p><h1>How will the funds be attributed?</h1><ol><li>Funds will be used exclusively to buy an electric tuk-tuk, lithium battery with an autonomy of ~100 - 120 km.</li></ol><h1>What does others support mean to you or your project?</h1><p>I have been wanting to get envolved in the crypto space and #buidl something because I support the idea of financial freedom for everyone that wants it. BCH is a tool that promotes that same idea.</p><p><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">The support of the BCH community means tremendously to me, as it shows how strong and united we are to help each other, in a peer to peer fashion.</span></p><h1>In what way can you prove your project is legitimate?</h1><p>I have arranged a budget with the amount of fiat currency I need and I will upload it.</p><p>I will whitelist a BCH address so that everyone can see when I receive payments in BCH for doing tours around Lisbon.<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">&nbsp;</span></p><h1>Why have you decided to fundraise, what motivated you to start?</h1><p>Being one of the best tuk-tuk drivers in Lisbon after starting it 4 months ago, I have had enough of giving 60 % of my revenue to my boss, which is quite a share..</p><h1>Thank those who help with your fundraiser</h1><p>I would like to write some words to those considering to donate.</p><p>It's funny that due to the blockchain anonymity, makes it harder to thank personally everyone. However, your donations will allow to spread the word to every tourist that will encounter BCH.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><br>
